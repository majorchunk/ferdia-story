  <h1>The Ferdia Story</h1>

  <body>
    <p><b>Foreword: Ireland is a special place for those of us who have been privileged to live here. It is renown worldwide for its beautiful green pastures, glens and valleys and the very friendly people who reside here.</b></p>
   
<p>In Irish mythology, thousands of years ago, Ireland was a beautiful country but very different to what we know today. Roadways were surprisingly quite good with most of them starting from Tara in county Meath, to all parts of Ireland. The only means of transport were horses and carts. The language spoken was an early version of Gaelic and would be very hard for most of us today to understand.</p>

<p>There were many small Kingdoms in Ireland at this time and wars broke out on a very regular basis. Rivers in particular, were a major difficulty to any advancing army as there were no bridges to cross over on, and some attempts to cross a river with horses and carts gave an opportunity for the opposing army to set up an ambush.</p>

<p>This is the story of the most epic single combat fought in ancient times between two best friends, who very reluctantly found themselves on opposite sides in a dispute where greed and pride were the driving force.</p>

<p>To understand how the fight came to be, why it happened and the devastating results that ensued, we rely heavily on the mythology writings in “An Tain” as being the primary recording of this epic event.</p>

<p>The two central characters in the fight were of course Ferdia who fought in the green corner of Connaught and Cú Chulainn who fought in the red corner of Ulster.</p>

    <p><b>Ferdia:</b></p>

<p>Ferdia was a son of Damán, who was a son of Dáire of the Fir Domnann. He was a warrior of great strength and agility and was lauded as the bravest warrior in all Connaught. In his earlier years like Cú Chulainn, he trained under the three renowned instructresses; Uathach (the dreadful), Áife (the handsome) and “Scáthach” (The Shadowy One).</p>

<p>During their time with Scáthach on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, both men became best friends and from then on would refer to each other as their foster brother.</p>

<p>Scáthach was very impressed with both as they were stronger than any of the other trainees and they were matched equally in every form of combat.</p>

<p>Around this time Aífe, Scáthach’s rival threatens Scáthach’s territory and both Ferdia and Cú Chulainn fought to help repel the threat. Aífe was defeated by Cú Chulainn and to honour both warrior’s effort on her behalf, Scáthach bestowed a formidable weapon to each of them. To Cú Chulainn, she gave him a devastating spear called The “Ga Bolga” and instructed him on the use of it. It is said that upon entering a body through one entry point, it opened into thirty barbs and shredded the body and could only be retrieved by cutting away the flesh from the victim.</p>

<p>To Ferdia, Scáthach gave him armoury that was horn skinned and could not be pierced by any known weapon.</p>

    <p>Cú Chulainn:</p>

<p>There are many stories relating to Cú Chulainn in “An Tain”. It is believed that Cú Chulainn was originally named Setanta and he was the son of Sualdam and Deichtine. However, it is also said that his real father was the sun god Lugh, who came to Deichtine in a dream. County Louth got its name from the sun god Lugh.</p>

<p>When Setanta was a young boy (5), he heard whispers from local kids about the existence of a school in County Armagh called the “Macra”. The school was run by a King named Conchúr and it’s said he used the school to train boys that showed promise how to be warriors for a famous order of fighters known as the Red Branch Knights.</p>

<p>Against his parents wishes, Setanta left that very day with a shield made from branches, a hurley (a stick) and a sliotar (a hard hurling ball). It was a long walk to Armagh, but Setanta eventually arrived and noticed a group of boys playing hurling near King Conchúr’s castle.</p>

<p>Setanta was a talented hurler and without waiting for an invite, he joined the game and scored a goal. The other boys were enraged at this unannounced intruder. They turned on Setanta and attacked him with their hurleys. Setanta was confused, but he quickly gained his composure and dodged each of the blows and punches. The King heard the commotion and walked to the pitch to see what was happening. When he arrived he saw that a small boy had knocked out over 30 others. The King realised immediately that Setanta was no ordinary child and he accepted him into the school.</p>

<p>He told Setanta that he would be the guest of honour being held in the castle that night. That night, the King arrived at the feast without a care in the world, forgetting that he had told Setanta to meet him outside. Believing that no others were to join them, a man named Culann released his savage hound into the castle grounds to ensure that no intruder attempted to enter.</p>

<p>Setanta walked through the grounds towards the castle, playing with his hurley and sliotar on the way. It was as he made his final ascent to the castle that he saw the hound running at him.</p>

<p>The King heard the growls and realised what was happening. The boy was about to be killed surely. However when the hound approached, Setanta used his hurley to hit the sliotar right into the hound’s mouth, choking him.</p>

<p>Culann and the king were both relieved when they saw that Setanta had escaped unharmed. Culann was relieved that Setanta had survived the encounter, but sad to have lost such a great guard dog.</p>

<p>To make up for killing him, young Setanta promised to guard Culann’s land until a new puppy had been reared. Impressed with such a noble promise, those at the feast agreed that Setanta should be given a name worthy of his bravery.</p>

    <p>From then on, Setanta was known as “Cú Chulainn” which translates to the “Hound of Culann”.</p>

<p>We have heard a little now about the two fearsome fighters who fought the epic battle. We now need to understand how the fight came to be, the plots that lay behind it and how two great friends ended up facing each other in a fight to the death.</p>

    <p>Queen Maeve of Connaught:</p>

<p>Queen Maeve of Connaught was a legendary figure in Irish mythology. She was a daughter of Eochaid Feidlech, a High King of Ireland. She was married to Conchúr Mac Nessa, the King of Ulster, as compensation for the slaying of Conchúr’s father Fachtna Fathach.</p>

<p>The marriage was not a good one though and when Maeve left her husband her father then offered his other daughter, Maeve’s sister Eithne, in marriage to Conchúr.</p>

<p>Setting the scene for her future deeds, Maeve murdered her own sister by drowning her while she was pregnant, the baby surviving the ordeal. An act of terrible ruthlessness and jealousy.</p>

<p>Maeve’s father took steps to control the situation. He was a powerful ruler and installed Maeve as Queen of Connaught, deposing Tinni Mac Conri and removing him from power.</p>

<p>Maeve then married Aillil (another High King of Ireland at that time). Maeve was a decisive and forceful ruler who ruled Connaught at that time with her new husband Aillil. She was an excellent warrior and general and assembled one of the mightiest fighting forces in Irish mythology. Her beauty and cunning was something that she used whenever she needed someone to do her bidding.</p>

<p>There is a fantastic heritage centre in Cruachan in Roscommon which is dedicated to Irish Mythology and Queen Maeve .</p>

    <p>Pride and greed in equal abundance.</p>

<p>Maeve and her husband Aillil began to tease each other about who held the highest status. Their teasing quickly grew earnest, as each tried to prove their superiority in the relationship. They were equal in birth, equal in status, and equal in power.</p>

<p>So to settle the matter they counted out all their belongings. The only difference between them was that Aillil had a magnificent white horned bull, while Maeve had nothing that could compare to it.</p>

<p>Maeve’s pride was hurt as she was unable to bear that she had any lesser role in their marriage. She sent messengers to search all of Ireland for a bull that was just as splendid as that possessed by her husband. Eventually a magnificent creature was found: the Brown Bull of Cooley.</p>

<p>Maeve sent a delegation to the bull’s owner, Daire Mac Fiachna of Cooley, offering gold, lands and many other favours if he would only agree to let her have the bull. Daire was initially inclined to grant her request, until he heard that one of her messengers was drunkenly boasting that if he would not sell it then Maeve would surely take the bull by force.</p>

<p>Daire resented being dictated to and reneged on the deal, refusing to part with the animal. Maeve assembled a great army of her allies from all over Ireland to invade Ulster and steal the bull. Thanks to the Ulster exiles in her ranks Maeve knew all about “The Curse of Macha”, which would put the enemy Ulster warriors out of action for five days and nights, giving her time to complete her mission.</p>

    <p>Táin Bó Cúailnge -The Cattle Raid of Cooley</p>

<p>Maeve was in the midst of preparing herself for the war when a servant knocked on her door to tell her of the arrival of a fortune-teller by the name of Fedelm.</p>

<p>The fortune-teller told Maeve about a horrific dream that she had the previous night that scared Maeve. It told of a young warrior from Ulster who had not succumbed to “the curse of Macha” and who was more powerful that any warrior in Ireland. His name was Cú Chulainn. He was just 17 years old and he was said to be ready and waiting for Maeve’s army. Like many at that time, Maeve was superstitious. She fully believed in what the fortune-teller told her. But surely Cú Chulainn would be no match for her army of thousands. She decided to go ahead anyway and the Táin Bó Cúailigne -Cattle Raid of Cooley began. It soon became clear that she was right to worry.</p>

    <p>Prelude to the Epic Fight</p>

<p>Cú Chulainn killed the first 300 warriors that Queen Maeve sent into battle. Word got back to her about what was happening, and she decided to send a messenger to Cú Chulainn to offer him great riches to change sides. He declined.</p>

<p>At this point Maeve’s army had progressed through counties Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Meath and had entered Louth. Her army needed to cross the river Dee where they had been held up by Cú Chulainn. Her army had camped outside the town of Ardee where there was a ford in the river Dee and was the only place for her army to cross the river.</p>

    <p>As the days went by, Cú Chulainn killed hundreds more of her men using only his slingshot.</p>

<p>Cú Chulainn then sent word to Queen Maeve that he would stop killing her men in mass numbers if she agreed to send just one man per day. The Queen was also made to promise that, during this battle, she would not attempt to steal the bull from the land of Ulster.</p>

<p>She agreed, surely, she thought, this would give her the time she needed to find a warrior that could match Cú Chulainn’s strength.</p>

<p>As was expected, Cú Chulainn continued to kill Maeve’s men one by one. As the time passed, Maeve’s army dwindled and dwindled. Then she had an idea – she’d ask Fergus, Cú Chulainn’s stepfather, to enter the battle.</p>

<p>Alas, this was no use. Although Fergus agreed after the promise of lands and riches, once he arrived at the battle site in Ardee, he realised that he could not go through with it. Cú Chulainn agreed to let Fergus walk free if Fergus agreed to return the favour if needed.</p>

    <p>Maeve’s Cunning</p>

<p>Maeve was unhappy that she was being held up, so she summoned her bravest warrior Ferdia to Her. She was aware that Ferdia and Cú Chulainn were great friends and she knew that he would be reluctant to fight with Cú Chulainn.</p>

<p>Ferdia refused to meet her initially and Maeve was furious. In an attempt to influence his decision, the Queen spread the word that Ferdia was a coward, and that he was scared of Cú Chulainn.</p>

<p>Ferida agreed to meet with Maeve, but let it be known that it was just to let her know that he was unhappy with the rumour that she had spread.</p>

<p>When he arrived at the meeting point, he discovered a great feast had been prepared. He also noticed a beautiful young woman sat at the table next to Maeve. It was her daughter Finnabair. When the serious discussions took place, Queen Maeve offered Ferdia, lands, riches and her daughter in marriage to fight Cú Chulainn.</p>

<p>Ferdia thanked the Queen for such a generous offer but he told her that he would not go in to battle against his step brother.</p>

<p>In a last ditch effort, the Queen pulled a masterstroke. She said to Ferdia that she understood his reaction as Cú Chulainn had predicted his response. Ferdia enquired of the Queen as to what she meant. Maeve told him that Cú Chulainn had said that Ferdia would be too afraid to take on the greatest warrior in Ireland as he knew he would have no chance of victory. These words hurt Ferdia’s pride and he took a few moments to consider this outrageous boast by Cú Chulainn. His pride got in the way and he agreed to take on Cú Chulainn on the ford of the river Dee, in Ardee.</p>

    <p>The Epic Battle</p>

<p>Cú Chulainn was dismayed and distressed when he heard that he was to face his great friend in battle. He could not understand why Ferdia was going to fight against him, but he was also not aware of the trick that Queen Maeve had pulled on Ferdia to get him to agree to the fight.</p>

<p>Word had got round the whole of Ireland and there was great interest in what was regarded as the greatest single combat ever to take place. Hoards of spectators gathered on both sides of the banks of the river Dee, to try and witness the pending battle.</p>

<p>Let’s try and visualise this ampi-theatre where the battle was fought. Below is a picture of where the battle is alleged to have occurred, where the stream meets the river Dee.</p>

    <p>Crowds had assembled on both sides of the river in eager anticipation of the impending fight.</p>

    <p>You could cut the atmosphere with a knife.</p>

<p>Ferdia was the first to make his way to the ford. His chariot was hitched and he set out from the camp along with his charioteer named Id, for the ford before daybreak. When he arrived the crowds on the south side of the river roared in support of their champion.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait until the sound of a rush and clatter of thunder was heard with Cú Chulainn’s chariot coming into view. His supporters on the north bank of the river Dee roared with excitement in support of their hero. Cú Chulainn pulled up his chariot on the north side of the ford accompanied by charioteer names Laeg. The scene was set.</p>

<p>The two great warriors faced each other on opposite banks of the river. Ferdia welcomed Cu Cuchulainn to the fray. Cú Chulainn rebuked his welcome telling Ferdia that he was the one that was the aggressor entering his homeland without invitation and fighting on Queen Maeve’s bidding. He reminded Ferdia of their staunch friendship when they were with Scáthach and how they had come to regard each other as foster brothers. He told him that Queen Maeve had used him by offering her daughter’s hand in marriage to Ferdia along with lands and riches. He questioned how these mere things could persuade Ferdia to fight his great friend. Cú Chulainn made an impassionate plea to Ferdia in the following words; “Ná Bris síth, ná bris cairdis” (Don’t break peace, don’t break friendship).</p>

<p>Ferdia told Cú Chulainn that it was not the prizes that were on offer that persuaded him to fight, but the treason that Cú Chulainn had spoken about him. (Cú Chulainn was not aware of the lies that Queen Maeve had told Ferdia). Ferdiad told Cú Chulainn that the time for talking was over and the fight was the only way forward.</p>

    <p>Reluctantly Cú Chulainn agreed to setting about the conditions of the fight.</p>

<p>Ferdia asked what weapons would they start with? Cú Chulainn told Ferdia that as he was the one to reach the ford first, he would have choice of weapons. The choice of weapons for the morning were two equally-matched shields, eight-edged targes, eight small darts and their eight straight-swords.</p>

<p>The fight commenced in the centre of the river, with both warriors not prepared to give an inch. But try as they might, because they were so well matched, neither was able to penetrate the other’s defence and neither bled during the morning’s fray. At noon they decided to take a break.</p>

    <p>A typical Gaelic Targe.</p>

<p>After a short break, Ferdia asked Cú Chulainn what weapons they would use for the afternoon. Cú Chulainn responded that Ferdia had the choice for the first day until nightfall. Ferdia decided that they would use their straight-cut, smooth hardened throwing spears along with their two hard shields.</p>

<p>They recommenced their battle with both men throwing their spears at each other from each side of the river. No matter how excellent the throwing was, neither could dominate. Both warriors did however create small wounds on their opponent. As the sun went low in the sky, they decided that the light was not great and agreed to rest for the night.</p>

<p>All of their weaponry was given to their charioteers and the two Warriors walked to the centre of the river to embrace. They put their hand on each other’s neck and gave each other three kisses. Their horses that night were held in the one paddock. Food was shared between the great warriors that night along with healing herbs for soothing the wounds inflicted on each other.</p>

<p>The following morning, (the second day) the friends met again at sunrise at the ford. Cú Chulainn asked Ferdia as to what weapons they were going to use today? Ferdia responded that as it was his choice the previous day, it was Cú Chulainn’s choice this day.</p>

<p>Cú Chualinn decided that they would fight with Lances this day on horse-back. He said that this might bring closer a decision to the battle, better than the weapons they had used the previous day. “Aye let’s do that” responded Ferdia.</p>

<p>The two great warriors fought tooth and nail throughout the day without either gaining the advantage.</p>

<p>As the light grew dim, Ferdia suggested that they end the battle for the day. Cú Chulainn agreed and both warriors again put their hand’s on each other’s shoulder and gave each other three kisses on the cheeks.</p>

<p>Food was shared that night, herbs for the soothing of injuries was also shared and both lay down in the same camp for the night.</p>

<p>Day three commenced with the sun rising and the two warriors entering the ford. What weapons will we use today asked Ferdia. Cú Chulainn replied that it was Ferdia’s turn to choose for the day ahead. Ferdia said they would use their two full-great long-shields, and their heavy, hard smiting swords and so it was agreed by Cú Chulainn.</p>

<p>They fought long and hard that day without either warrior prepared to give an inch. Both warriors did receive a number of wounds that day by the hard smiting swords and the river ran red with their blood. As nightfall approached, both warriors decided to call a halt to proceedings. Again, they kissed each other’s cheeks 3 times and shared food and healing herbs.</p>

<p>The fourth day loomed with the rising of the sun. Both warriors knew that it was likely that one would savour victory on this day and the other defeat as they were growing tired and were nursing wounds. It was agreed that they would use shields, striking-spears and falchion swords.</p>

<p>Ferdia decided to wear his horn shinned armour for extra protection as it was quite likely that Cú Chulainn would bring out his famous “Ga Bolga”. Ferdia’s armour could not be pierced by any known weapon but there was one weakness. From below, there was no protection as there needed to be an opening for him to put it on. So, for further protection, Ferdia tied a rock between his legs, so as to prevent an attack in this manner.</p>

<p>The fight re-commenced with both men giving their all. Time and time again, a lung would be made by one warrior and was repelled by the other.</p>

<p>Cú Chulainn made a mighty leap at Ferdia so as to try and get him from above. Ferdia gave a violent rattle of his shield when he was in mid-air and Cú Chulainn was forced backwards into the middle of the ford. Ferdiad seized the opportunity and buried his tusk-hilted blade into Cú Chulainn’s breast and his blood fell into his belt, till the ford became crimsoned with the clotted blood from the battle-warrior’s body.</p>

<p>Cú Chulainn sensing that his end was near called on his friends from the fairy world to come to his aid. Dolb and Indolb, two fairy warriors immediately appeared and stepped into the fray to defend their friend. Ferdia had now three warriors to defeat.</p>

<p>Ferdia shouted to Cú Chulainn that he had deceived him as he had not disclosed that he could call on Dolb and Indolb to support him. Cú Chulainn told him that he could not disclose it, as to do so would have rendered the spell useless.</p>

<p>Ferdia fought the three warrior’s with all his might. The fairy warrior’s inflicted three great heavy wounds on him. It was then that Ferdia made a cast to the right and slew Dolb with his sword. During this time, Cú Chulainn had called out to his henchman Laeg for his “Ga Bolga”. Cú Chualinn had discussed this strategy with Laeg the previous night and told him that should he call out to him, that he arrange for the Ga Bolga to float by him by unblocking part of the dam. Ferdia had also discussed this potential strategy with Id the previous night and he instructed Id to prevent Laeg from doing so. To complicate matters more Id and Laeg were brothers and Id was no match for Laeg in combat. Laeg attempted to put the weapon into the water in such a way that it would float down to Cú Chulainn. Id undid the work done by Laeg. Cú chualinn shouted with rage to Laeg to get the Ga Gulga in position. Laeg did not want to use weapons against Id so he jumped upon him and threw many punches to Id’s head and broke his nose and damaged his eyesight. He then made ready the Ga Bolga. At this stage Ferdia was continuing to fight off the second fairy warrior. He then made a cast to the right and slew Indolb with a thrusting blow.</p>

<p>He was now up close to Cú Chulainn. For a split second, he felt sorry for his great friend. Just then the mighty weapon flowed parallel to the two warriors. In order to distract Ferdia, Cu Chulainn threw his spear at Ferdia’s upper body. Ferdia reacted by lifting his shield to defend himself. Cú Chualinn then flicked the Ga Bolga with his foot upwards between Ferdia’s legs. The mighty weapon split the rock protecting Ferdiad and ripped up through his body. The thirty barbs tore through his body destroying everything in its path.</p>

    <p>Ferdia said: Ah, that now sufficeth, I am fallen.</p>

    <p>His final words were;</p>

    <p>“O Cú of grand feats,</p>

    <p>unfairly am I slain!</p>

    <p>Thy guilt clings to me;</p>

    <p>My blood falls on thee!</p>

    <p>No meed for the wretch</p>

    <p>Who treads treason’s gap.</p>

    <p>Now weak is my voice;</p>

    <p>Ah, gone is my bloom!</p>

    <p>My rib’s armour burst,</p>

    <p>My heart is all gore;</p>

    <p>I battled not well;</p>

    <p>I’m smitten. O Cú!</p>

<p>Cú Chulainn hastened towards his friend who had breathed his last, and clasped his arms about him, and bore him with all his armoury and his dress northwards over the ford, so it should be with his face to the north of the ford where the triump took place.</p>

<p>Laeg shouted to his champion that they needed to leave the ford immediately or the men from the west might come to finish him off. They left the scene of the fight with Cú Chulainn very distressed. Cú Chulainn was to go on in Irish mythology to have many more great adventures, but he was never the same warrior due to the loss of his great friend.</p>

    <p>This battle was the greatest single combat in Irish mythology.</p>

<p>Ardee, Co. Louth, where the battle took place is known as “Atha Fhirdia” which is translated to mean “the town of the ford of Ferdia”.</p>

<p>In honouring the epic battle between the two great warriors, Ardee have adopted the town crest as follows:</p>

<p>The inscription reads, “Na bris Síth, Na bris cairdis” which is the plea that Cu Chulainn made to Ferdia to try and prevent the battle happening, “Don’t break peace, Don’t break friendship”.</p>
